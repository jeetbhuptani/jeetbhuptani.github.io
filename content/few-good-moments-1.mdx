Hii! This is my first ever blog and I am not yet commiting myself to write
such blogs and being consistent, Being an extravert, this side of my life has
always been hidden and undiscovered by me.. but it changed today in a lecture
at college when few questions and scenarios of life where unfold in front of
me by the professor.

Today was my last lecture of that subject in Semester 5th, and with syllabus
completed, Our sir recaped few concepts we learned and motivated us to just
not pursue carrier and money but a happy healthy life too.

What happened at the class today —  
While topics related discussion, sir try to refresh us with thought of
enjoying our college life. He asked — “**are you enjoying the college
life?”,** we all replied with a big!! **“NOO!!”.**

> But not me my heart, my mind and my soul were happy and said **I am!**

With this, the excuses of students about academics load, exams and semester-
end assessments begins, and then sir started explaining a few things, and then
he said — **“I have seen with facilities available students go back to there
home even if it’s a 6–8 hrs long journey”** and yes that’s true

> For me it’s an 2 hrs long run till I reach my home

Sir said — **“Even after going to home I am sure you may not spending time
with your parents..and all other things”** and then I smiled again with the
joy saying myself

> How to tell you sir yesterday I had one of best time of my life which will
> never come back,

how to tell you that we had a homemade dinner, a desert and at last after
watching two episodes of some entertainment, me and my parents had one of the
deepest conversion of life, where we spend countless minutes talking, it was
midnight untill we realised I have to wake up early and go back tomorrow.

> Before sleeping my father put his firm hand on my head, shaked a little and
> said — **“This is life kid, Everything in life happens for a reason, and I
> trust in god whatever happens is meant for something good in the end.”**

With this I was happy enough to realise that even if I may not be the best
horse in race of carrier, I had already won my life with such beautiful
moments to live…..

Thanks to sir, for making me remember again that there is a world outside the
stress and struggle for materialistic goals

Thanks to my parents for the support I got to stay lively, healthy, up and
running…!
